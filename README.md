# GitHub User Search App

Hi there! üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòä Welcome to my Github User Search App - my solution to the [GitHub user search app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6).

This was a personal project to expand my React knowledge and further refine my skills in fethcing data from APIs and displaying it dynamically in user interface elements.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Frontend Mentor provides a platform for developers to enhance their skills by completing real-world projects. The GitHub User Search App challenge involves designing and implementing a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and view user information.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences.

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties with Sass
- BEM Classes
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I Learned

#### Dark/Light Modes Implementation:

For my fist time implementing dark/light mode, I researched various solutions, ultimately opting for a Theme Provider pattern to manage and toggle between themes seamlessly.

#### Custom CSS Variables in React:

I delved into the creation and manipulation of custom CSS variables to facilitate dynamic styling based on the selected theme. This allowed for more flexible and maintainable theming options within the React application.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
```

### Continued development

#### Optimizing Dark/Light Mode Toggle:

While the current implementation of the dark/light mode toggle is functional, I aim to explore more efficient methods for seamless theming transitions, possibly exploring state management libraries to enhance the user experience.

#### Utilizing CSS Grid:

I plan to delve into the capabilities of CSS Grid for layout management. Integrating CSS Grid into the project will allow for more streamlined and responsive designs, offering an opportunity to enhance the overall structure and visual appeal of the application.

#### Exploring Tailwind CSS:

To further streamline the styling process, I intend to incorporate Tailwind CSS into the project for its efficient and scalable way of styling components, as well as the ease of implementing dark/light mode.
